# PR: Ticket 5 - Tasks CRUD API Endpoints

## Original Ticket

**Ticket 5: Tasks CRUD API Endpoints**
**Assignee**: [MARK]  
**Dependencies**: Tickets 2, 4  
**Priority**: High

**Description**: Implement RESTful API endpoints for task management (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

**Deliverables**:
- Create `server/routes/tasks.js` with all CRUD endpoints
- Implement GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH operations
- Use parameterized SQL queries for security
- Follow RESTful conventions as per architecture spec

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] GET `/api/tasks` - Returns all tasks
- [x] POST `/api/tasks` - Creates new task
- [x] PUT `/api/tasks/:id` - Updates existing task
- [x] DELETE `/api/tasks/:id` - Deletes task
- [x] PATCH `/api/tasks/:id/status` - Updates task status only
- [x] All endpoints use parameterized queries
- [x] Proper error handling and status codes
- [x] Response format matches architecture specification

## What I've Done

Implemented a complete RESTful API for task management with five endpoints covering all CRUD operations:

1. **Created `server/routes/tasks.js`** with Express router and five handler functions
2. **Implemented comprehensive validation** for all inputs (required fields, valid IDs, status constraints)
3. **Added security measures** using parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection attacks
4. **Integrated routes** into the main Express application via `/api/tasks` mount point
5. **Tested all endpoints** with various scenarios including error conditions
6. **Followed project standards** from CLAUDE.md for naming conventions and code patterns

## How I Worked with Claude

- **Initial Review**: I asked Claude to review all project documentation (CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, FUNCTIONAL.md, TICKETS.md) to understand requirements and standards
- **Planning Phase**: Used Claude's TodoWrite tool to break down the ticket into manageable subtasks for systematic implementation
- **Implementation Guidance**: Claude provided the complete route implementation following our established patterns (CommonJS, async/await, parameterized queries)
- **Testing Strategy**: Claude suggested comprehensive testing approach covering both success and error scenarios
- **Standards Compliance**: I ensured Claude's implementation matched our camelCase function naming, error handling patterns, and response format specifications

My own contributions:
- Validated that the implementation matched all architecture requirements
- Reviewed the database schema to ensure proper field mapping
- Confirmed integration with existing Express app structure

## Code Understanding

**Route Handler Pattern**: Each endpoint follows a consistent pattern with try/catch error handling, input validation, database operations using parameterized queries, and structured JSON responses.

**GET `/api/tasks`**: 
```javascript
const getAllTasks = async (req, res, next) => {
  const result = await db.query('SELECT * FROM tasks ORDER BY created_at DESC');
  res.json({ success: true, data: result.rows });
}
```
Returns all tasks ordered by creation date (newest first) for optimal user experience.

**POST `/api/tasks`**: Validates required title field, trims whitespace, and creates new tasks with default 'todo' status. Uses `RETURNING *` to return the created task with auto-generated ID and timestamps.

**PUT `/api/tasks/:id`**: Full task update with existence checking. Uses `COALESCE($3, status)` to optionally update status or preserve existing value.

**DELETE `/api/tasks/:id`**: Removes task and returns deleted data for frontend confirmation. Handles non-existent tasks with 404 response.

**PATCH `/api/tasks/:id/status`**: Specialized endpoint for status-only updates, enforcing valid status values ('todo', 'doing', 'done') with database constraints.

## Architectural Considerations

**RESTful Design**: Follows HTTP verb conventions (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for full updates, DELETE for removal, PATCH for partial updates) as specified in ARCHITECTURE.md.

**Security First**: All database queries use parameterized statements (`$1, $2, etc.`) preventing SQL injection attacks. Input validation occurs before database operations.

**Consistent Response Format**: All endpoints return structured JSON with `success` boolean and `data` fields, matching the architecture specification for frontend predictability.

**Error Handling Integration**: Uses Express error middleware via `next(error)` for centralized error processing, maintaining consistency with existing application structure.

**Database Integration**: Leverages the existing connection pool from `server/db/connection.js` for efficient resource management and consistent database access patterns.

## Testing Approach

**Manual API Testing**: Used curl commands to test all endpoints with various scenarios:
- Valid requests returning expected data formats
- Error conditions (missing fields, invalid IDs, non-existent resources)
- Input validation (empty titles, invalid status values)
- Database constraint enforcement

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ GET `/api/tasks` - Returns existing sample data correctly
- ✅ POST `/api/tasks` - Creates tasks with proper validation
- ✅ PUT `/api/tasks/:id` - Updates existing tasks completely
- ✅ DELETE `/api/tasks/:id` - Removes tasks and handles 404s
- ✅ PATCH `/api/tasks/:id/status` - Status-only updates with validation
- ✅ Error handling for invalid inputs and non-existent resources

**Integration Testing**: Verified the routes work correctly with the existing Express application and database connection pool.

## What I Learned

**New concepts/techniques I discovered**:
- Express router pattern for organizing related endpoints
- PostgreSQL parameterized queries for security and performance
- RESTful endpoint design principles and HTTP status code best practices
- Express error middleware integration for centralized error handling

**Challenges faced and how I overcame them**:
- Ensuring proper input validation without over-engineering - solved by implementing focused validation for each endpoint's specific requirements
- Balancing comprehensive error handling with clean code - used consistent try/catch patterns with Express error middleware
- Database constraint enforcement - leveraged PostgreSQL CHECK constraints in schema along with application-level validation

**How I'd approach similar problems in future**:
- Start with comprehensive documentation review to understand all requirements and constraints
- Use todo lists for systematic implementation tracking
- Test each endpoint thoroughly before moving to the next
- Prioritize security (parameterized queries) and validation from the beginning rather than adding later
