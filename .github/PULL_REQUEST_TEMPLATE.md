# PR: Ticket 6 - ApiClient Class

## Original Ticket

**Ticket 6: ApiClient Class**
**Assignee**: [JAZ]  
**Dependencies**: Ticket 5  
**Priority**: High

**Description**: Create centralized API client for communication with backend endpoints.

**Deliverables**:
- Create `client/scripts/ApiClient.js` with all HTTP methods
- Implement async/await patterns for API calls
- Add error handling and response parsing
- Follow naming conventions from CLAUDE.md

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Static class with methods for all CRUD operations
- [x] getTasks(), createTask(), updateTask(), deleteTask(), updateTaskStatus() methods
- [x] Consistent error handling across all methods
- [x] Async/await pattern used throughout
- [x] Proper HTTP status code handling


## What I've Done

Implemented a centralized API client class that serves as the communication layer between frontend components and backend endpoints:

1. **Created `client/scripts/ApiClient.js`** with static class pattern using ES6 modules and named exports
2. **Implemented all 5 CRUD methods** corresponding to the backend API endpoints MARK created in Ticket 5
3. **Applied consistent error handling** using try/catch blocks with detailed error propagation
4. **Used async/await throughout** for clean, readable asynchronous code
5. **Followed CLAUDE.md standards** for naming conventions, module patterns, and error handling
6. **Verified dependency completion** by checking that all prerequisite backend tickets were implemented


## How I Worked with Claude

- **Dependency Verification**: I first asked Claude to check TICKETS.md and verify all prerequisite tickets were complete before proceeding with implementation
- **Standards Review**: Claude reviewed CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and FUNCTIONAL.md to understand project requirements and coding standards
- **Design Discussion**: We discussed the tradeoffs between returning full response objects vs. just data, deciding on clean data returns with robust error handling
- **Error Handling Strategy**: I specifically asked Claude to use try/catch methods for error handling, which led to a comprehensive error management approach
- **Implementation Guidance**: Claude provided the complete ApiClient implementation following our established ES6 class patterns and async/await conventions


My own contributions:
- Confirmed the implementation approach aligned with our architecture decisions
- Validated that error handling strategy met our development needs
- Ensured the static class pattern matched our frontend component design
- Verified compatibility with the backend API response format


## Code Understanding

**Static Class Pattern**: ApiClient uses a static class with all methods accessible without instantiation, making it a clean singleton pattern for API communication.

**Error Handling Strategy**: Each method follows a consistent pattern:
```javascript
try {
  const response = await fetch(url, options);
  const responseData = await response.json();
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(responseData.message || `HTTP ${response.status}: ...`);
  }
  
  return responseData.data; // Clean data extraction
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error description:', error);
  throw error; // Propagate for component handling
}
```

**Data Return Strategy**: Methods return just the data portion of API responses (`responseData.data`) while preserving full error context in thrown exceptions.

**HTTP Method Mapping**: Direct 1:1 mapping to backend endpoints:
- `getTasks()` → GET `/api/tasks`
- `createTask(data)` → POST `/api/tasks`
- `updateTask(id, data)` → PUT `/api/tasks/:id`
- `deleteTask(id)` → DELETE `/api/tasks/:id`
- `updateTaskStatus(id, status)` → PATCH `/api/tasks/:id/status`


## Architectural Considerations

**Frontend-Backend Separation**: ApiClient creates a clean abstraction layer that isolates frontend components from HTTP details and response parsing logic.

**Error Boundary**: Centralizes all API error handling in one location while allowing components to handle errors contextually through try/catch in their own code.

**Data Flow Simplification**: Components receive clean task objects directly without needing to unwrap response structures, making component code more focused on UI logic.

**Static Pattern Benefits**: No instantiation required means any component can import and use ApiClient without state management concerns.

**Async/Await Consistency**: All methods use modern async patterns that integrate seamlessly with frontend component lifecycle methods.

**Future Extensibility**: The pattern easily accommodates future endpoints (like AI advice generation in upcoming tickets) without architectural changes.


## Testing Approach

**Dependency Verification**: Confirmed all backend endpoints from Ticket 5 are implemented and functional before ApiClient development.

**Manual Integration Testing**: 
- Verified backend API endpoints return expected response format
- Confirmed database schema matches expected task object structure
- Tested error scenarios to ensure proper error message propagation

**Code Review Testing**:
- ✅ All 5 CRUD methods implemented with correct HTTP verbs
- ✅ Consistent error handling pattern across all methods
- ✅ Proper async/await usage throughout
- ✅ ES6 module exports following project standards
- ✅ Method signatures match ARCHITECTURE.md specification

**Future Testing**: Ready for integration testing with TaskCard, Board, and TaskForm components in subsequent tickets.


## What I Learned

**New concepts/techniques I discovered**:
- Static class patterns for singleton API clients in frontend applications
- Error propagation strategies that preserve backend error context while simplifying component interfaces
- ES6 module patterns with named exports for better dependency management
- Async/await error handling with try/catch for clean, readable asynchronous code


**Challenges faced and how I overcame them**:
- **Data vs Response Object Decision**: Discussed tradeoffs between returning full API responses vs clean data objects - chose data-only approach for simpler component interfaces while preserving error details
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Needed to balance comprehensive error capture with clean error propagation - solved with try/catch that logs for debugging but re-throws for component handling
- **Dependency Coordination**: Had to verify backend completion before proceeding - established systematic dependency checking process using project documentation


**How I'd approach similar problems in future**:
- Always verify dependencies thoroughly before implementation to avoid integration issues
- Discuss architectural decisions (like data return strategies) upfront to ensure alignment with component needs
- Establish consistent error handling patterns early and apply them uniformly across all methods
- Use static class patterns for stateless service layers that need to be accessed from multiple components
- Prioritize async/await patterns for cleaner, more maintainable asynchronous code
