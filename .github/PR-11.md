# PR: Ticket 11 - AI Service Implementation

## Original Ticket

### Ticket 11: AI Service Implementation
**Assignee**: [MARK]  
**Dependencies**: Ticket 5  
**Priority**: Medium

**Description**: Implement AI service for generating task advice using OpenAI API.

**Deliverables**:
- Create `server/services/aiService.js` with OpenAI integration
- Implement comprehensive prompt engineering for task analysis
- Add error handling for API failures and rate limits
- Create endpoint for AI advice generation

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] AiService class with OpenAI API integration
- [ ] generateTaskAdvice() method with comprehensive prompts
- [ ] Error handling for API timeouts, rate limits, network failures
- [ ] POST `/api/tasks/:id/advice` endpoint implemented
- [ ] Generated advice stored in database with timestamp
- [ ] Environment variable configuration for API key

## What I've Done

I've successfully implemented the complete AI service integration for the Kanban board application:

1. **Installed OpenAI dependency** - Added `openai` package to project dependencies
2. **Created AiService class** - Built `/server/services/aiService.js` with full OpenAI API integration
3. **Implemented comprehensive prompt engineering** - Created detailed prompts covering risk management, best practices, and implementation strategies
4. **Added robust error handling** - Comprehensive error categorization for timeouts, rate limits, authentication failures, and network issues
5. **Created API endpoint** - Added `POST /api/tasks/:id/advice` to `/server/routes/tasks.js`
6. **Database integration** - Updates `ai_advice` and `ai_advice_timestamp` fields when advice is generated
7. **Environment configuration** - Uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` from environment variables (already documented in `.env.example`)
8. **Model upgrade** - Updated to use GPT-4o instead of GPT-3.5-turbo for better advice quality

## How I Worked with Claude

- **Initial prompt**: Asked Claude to implement Ticket 11 following the project's CLAUDE.md standards
- **Refinement process**: Claude suggested using GPT-3.5-turbo initially, but I requested an upgrade to GPT-4o for better performance
- **Knowledge gaps filled**: Claude helped ensure proper error handling patterns and comprehensive prompt engineering
- **Standards compliance**: Claude followed the established naming conventions (PascalCase for classes, camelCase for methods) and async/await patterns

## Code Understanding

### AiService Class (`/server/services/aiService.js`)
- **Constructor**: Validates `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable and initializes OpenAI client with configuration validation
- **generateTaskAdvice()**: Main method that takes task title/description and returns AI-generated advice using GPT-4o
- **createComprehensivePrompt()**: Crafts detailed prompts covering three key areas:
  - Risk management and potential blockers
  - Best practices and optimization recommendations  
  - Implementation strategies and efficient approaches
- **handleApiError()**: Categorizes OpenAI API errors and provides user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios

### API Endpoint (`/server/routes/tasks.js`)
- **generateTaskAdvice()**: Route handler that:
  - Validates task ID parameter
  - Retrieves task details from database
  - Calls AiService to generate advice
  - Stores generated advice with timestamp in database
  - Returns structured response with advice and metadata
- **Route definition**: `router.post('/:id/advice', generateTaskAdvice)` follows RESTful conventions

## Architectural Considerations

This implementation aligns perfectly with our architectural principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: AI logic isolated in dedicated service class, API logic in route handlers
- **RESTful Design**: New endpoint follows existing patterns (`POST /api/tasks/:id/advice`)
- **Database Integration**: Uses existing PostgreSQL connection pool with parameterized queries for security
- **Error Handling**: Consistent with existing error handling patterns throughout the application
- **Environment Configuration**: Leverages existing dotenv setup for secure API key management
- **Response Format**: Follows established `{success: boolean, data: object}` pattern

## Testing Approach

Manual testing approach following project's testing strategy:

1. **Environment Setup**: Verified OPENAI_API_KEY configuration loads correctly
2. **API Endpoint Testing**: Will test with curl commands once API key is configured:
   ```bash
   # Test successful advice generation
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/1/advice
   
   # Test invalid task ID
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/999/advice
   ```
3. **Error Scenario Testing**: Plan to test API failures, rate limits, and network issues
4. **Database Verification**: Check that advice and timestamps are properly stored
5. **Integration Testing**: Verify the endpoint works with existing task CRUD operations

## What I Learned

### New Concepts/Techniques Discovered
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Understanding the chat completions API structure and parameter configuration
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Learning to categorize different API failure modes and provide appropriate user feedback
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts that generate actionable, structured advice for task management

### Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them
- **Error Classification**: Initially needed to research different OpenAI API error types to provide meaningful user messages
- **Database Schema**: Had to understand existing database structure to properly store advice with timestamps
- **Route Integration**: Ensuring the new endpoint followed existing patterns and validation approaches

### How I'd Approach Similar Problems in Future
- **Start with Error Handling**: Plan comprehensive error scenarios upfront rather than adding them later
- **Service Isolation**: Keep external API logic completely separate from route handling for better testability
- **Environment Validation**: Always validate external service configuration on startup rather than at runtime
- **Prompt Iteration**: Design prompts to be easily modifiable as requirements evolve
