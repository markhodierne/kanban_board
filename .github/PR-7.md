# PR: Ticket 7 - TaskCard Component Class

## Original Ticket

**Ticket 7: TaskCard Component Class**
- **Assignee**: JAZ
- **Dependencies**: Ticket 6 (ApiClient Class)
- **Priority**: High

**Description**: Create TaskCard class for rendering and managing individual task cards.

**Key Requirements**:
- Create `client/scripts/TaskCard.js` with ES6 class
- Implement task rendering with all UI elements
- Add inline editing functionality for title and description
- Include status change buttons and delete functionality
- Placeholder for AI advice section (without functionality yet)

## What I've Done

**Files Created/Modified**:
- ✅ Created `client/scripts/TaskCard.js` - Complete ES6 class implementation
- ✅ Updated `client/styles/main.css` - Added styles for inline editing and AI advice placeholder

**Core Implementation**:
- **TaskCard Class**: Constructor accepts task object, maintains component state
- **render() Method**: Generates complete HTML structure with all required UI elements
- **Inline Editing**: Double-click to edit title/description with Enter/Escape/blur handling
- **Status Management**: Dynamic status buttons (Start → Complete → Restart cycle)
- **Delete Functionality**: Confirmation dialog with API integration
- **Event System**: Custom events for Board class communication
- **AI Placeholder**: Styled section ready for future AI integration

## How I Worked with Claude

Claude provided the complete implementation based on:
- Analysis of existing CSS patterns and color scheme
- Integration requirements with ApiClient class
- CLAUDE.md standards compliance
- ARCHITECTURE.md component specifications

My own contributions:
- Requested explanation of the `selectAllText()` function to understand DOM Range API
- Validated that the implementation meets all Definition of Done criteria
- Confirmed the approach aligns with established patterns from previous tickets

## Code Understanding

**Key Technical Patterns**:

1. **Event Delegation Within Component**:
   ```javascript
   this.element.addEventListener('click', (e) => this.handleClick(e));
   this.element.addEventListener('dblclick', (e) => this.handleDoubleClick(e));
   ```
   Events are bound to the component's root element and delegated to handlers

2. **Inline Editing State Management**:
   ```javascript
   this.isEditing = false;
   this.originalContent = null;
   ```
   Component tracks editing state to prevent conflicts and enable cancel functionality

3. **Custom Event Communication**:
   ```javascript
   this.dispatchTaskUpdate('status-changed');
   ```
   Communicates with parent Board class without tight coupling

4. **Async API Integration**:
   ```javascript
   await ApiClient.updateTask(this.task.id, updatedData);
   ```
   All CRUD operations use established ApiClient patterns with error handling

## Architectural Considerations

**Component Responsibility**: TaskCard handles its own rendering, user interactions, and API communication while emitting events for parent coordination

**Data Flow**: Follows unidirectional pattern - task data flows in via constructor, changes flow out via custom events and API calls

**CSS Integration**: Leverages existing design system (color variables, .btn base class) while adding component-specific styles

**API Communication**: Uses centralized ApiClient maintaining consistent error handling and response patterns established in Ticket 6

**Future Extensibility**: AI advice section structure ready for Ticket 12 implementation without breaking changes

## Testing Approach

**Manual Testing Scenarios**:
- [x] Task card renders with all visual elements
- [x] Double-click enables inline editing with text selection
- [x] Enter/Escape/blur save/cancel editing correctly
- [x] Status buttons cycle through todo → doing → done → todo
- [x] Delete button shows confirmation and removes task
- [x] Empty title validation prevents saving
- [x] API errors display user-friendly messages
- [x] CSS classes follow kebab-case convention
- [x] AI advice placeholder displays correctly

**Integration Testing**:
- Component integrates with existing CSS grid layout
- Custom events properly bubble for Board class handling
- ApiClient integration maintains established patterns

## What I Learned

**New concepts/techniques I discovered**:
- **DOM Range API**: Understanding `document.createRange()` and `Selection` API for programmatic text selection in contentEditable elements
- **Event Delegation Patterns**: How to combine component-scoped event delegation with custom event bubbling for parent communication
- **ContentEditable Best Practices**: Using `contentEditable="true"` with proper keyboard navigation (Enter/Escape) and blur handling
- **CSS Dashed Borders**: Using `border: 1px dashed` for placeholder styling that indicates future functionality

**Challenges faced and how I overcame them**:
- **State Management**: Preventing editing conflicts by tracking `isEditing` state and storing `originalContent` for cancellation
- **Validation Handling**: Balancing client-side validation (empty title check) with server-side error handling
- **Event Coordination**: Designing custom events that provide sufficient data for Board class without creating tight coupling
- **CSS Integration**: Extending existing design system without breaking established patterns

**How I'd approach similar problems in future**:
- **Component Design**: Start with clear responsibility boundaries - what the component owns vs. what it communicates to parents
- **Editing UX**: Always provide both keyboard (Enter/Escape) and mouse (blur) interaction patterns for accessibility
- **Error Handling**: Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback on API failures for better user experience
- **CSS Architecture**: Build on existing design tokens and base classes rather than creating isolated styles
