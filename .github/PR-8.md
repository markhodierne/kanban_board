# PR: Ticket 8 - Board Management Class

## Original Ticket

**Ticket 8: Board Management Class**  
**Assignee**: JAZ  
**Dependencies**: Ticket 7 (TaskCard Component Class)  
**Priority**: High

**Description**: Create Board class to manage the overall Kanban board state and task organization.

**Deliverables**:
- Create `client/scripts/Board.js` with ES6 class
- Implement task loading and rendering across columns
- Handle task movement between columns
- Manage board state and UI updates

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Board class with constructor accepting container ID
- [x] loadTasks() method fetches and displays all tasks
- [x] renderBoard() method organizes tasks by status
- [x] addTaskToColumn() method handles new task placement
- [x] moveTask() method handles status changes
- [x] Integration with TaskCard and ApiClient classes
- [x] Event delegation for performance

## What I've Done

### Core Implementation
1. **Created Board Management Class** (`client/scripts/Board.js`):
   - Implemented ES6 class with constructor that accepts container ID
   - Added DOM validation to ensure required column elements exist
   - Created mapping between task statuses ('todo', 'doing', 'done') and DOM columns

2. **Task Loading & Rendering System**:
   - `loadTasks()` method fetches all tasks via ApiClient and triggers board rendering
   - `renderBoard()` method clears columns and organizes tasks by status
   - `addTaskToColumn()` method creates TaskCard instances and places them in correct columns
   - Automatic task count updates in column headers

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Set up event delegation using custom 'taskUpdate' events from TaskCard components
   - Implemented handlers for task status changes, deletions, and modifications
   - Ensured UI and internal state remain synchronized

4. **Updated HTML Structure** (`client/index.html`):
   - Removed static placeholder tasks to enable dynamic rendering
   - Added ES6 module initialization script with proper error handling
   - Implemented graceful fallback for initialization failures

### Key Features
- **Real-time State Management**: Board maintains local task array synchronized with database
- **Dynamic Column Updates**: Task counts automatically update in column headers
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error display with user-friendly messaging
- **Performance Optimization**: Event delegation prevents memory leaks with dynamic content

## How I Worked with Claude

Claude provided architectural guidance and helped implement the Board class according to established patterns from `CLAUDE.md`. The collaboration focused on:

My own contributions:
- Analyzed the existing TaskCard and ApiClient implementations to understand integration points
- Designed the event delegation strategy for handling TaskCard interactions
- Implemented comprehensive error handling for both API failures and DOM validation
- Created the task count display feature for enhanced user experience

## Code Understanding

**Board Class Architecture** (`client/scripts/Board.js:1-165`):
```javascript
export class Board {
    constructor(containerId) {
        // DOM validation and column mapping
        this.columns = {
            'todo': this.container.querySelector('#todo-column .task-list'),
            'doing': this.container.querySelector('#doing-column .task-list'),
            'done': this.container.querySelector('#done-column .task-list')
        };
    }
    
    async loadTasks() {
        // Fetch tasks from API and render board
        this.tasks = await ApiClient.getTasks();
        this.renderBoard();
    }
    
    addTaskToColumn(task, status) {
        // Create TaskCard instance and add to DOM
        const taskCard = new TaskCard(task);
        const taskElement = taskCard.render();
        column.appendChild(taskElement);
    }
}
```

**Event Integration**: The Board listens for custom 'taskUpdate' events bubbled up from TaskCard components, enabling loose coupling while maintaining reactive updates.

**State Synchronization**: Local task array is updated whenever tasks are modified, ensuring UI reflects current database state without unnecessary re-fetches.

## Architectural Considerations

**Component Integration**:
- Board serves as the coordinator between TaskCard components and ApiClient
- Uses composition pattern - Board contains TaskCard instances rather than inheritance
- Maintains separation of concerns: Board handles layout/state, TaskCard handles individual task interactions

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Event delegation from main container prevents memory leaks with dynamic content
- Selective DOM updates rather than full re-renders when tasks change status
- Efficient column clearing and rebuilding for state changes

**Error Resilience**:
- DOM validation in constructor prevents runtime errors
- API failure handling with user feedback
- Graceful degradation when initialization fails

**Follows CLAUDE.md Standards**:
- ✅ camelCase function names (`loadTasks`, `renderBoard`, `addTaskToColumn`)
- ✅ ES6 class structure with proper imports/exports
- ✅ Async/await patterns throughout
- ✅ Event delegation for performance
- ✅ Consistent error handling with console logging + user feedback

## Testing Approach

**Manual Integration Testing**:
1. **Board Initialization**: Verified constructor properly maps DOM elements and validates structure
2. **Task Loading**: Confirmed `loadTasks()` fetches from API and renders tasks in correct columns
3. **State Management**: Tested task status changes update both local state and DOM
4. **Event Handling**: Verified TaskCard events properly bubble up and trigger Board updates
5. **Error Scenarios**: Tested API failures and DOM validation errors display appropriate messages

**Integration Points Verified**:
- Board ↔ ApiClient: All CRUD operations work through centralized API client
- Board ↔ TaskCard: Custom events enable reactive updates without tight coupling
- Board ↔ HTML: Dynamic rendering replaces static placeholder content

## What I Learned

**New concepts/techniques I discovered**:
- **Event Delegation Pattern**: Using a single event listener on the container to handle all TaskCard interactions prevents memory leaks and improves performance with dynamic content
- **Component Coordination**: How to design loosely coupled components that communicate through custom events while maintaining clear separation of concerns
- **State Synchronization Strategies**: Balancing between local state management and API synchronization for optimal user experience

**Challenges faced and how I overcame them**:
- **Module Integration**: Initially unclear how ES6 modules would work between Board, TaskCard, and ApiClient classes. Solved by carefully managing imports and ensuring proper export patterns
- **Event Bubbling**: TaskCard events needed to reach Board without creating tight coupling. Implemented custom events with bubbling to maintain clean architecture
- **DOM State Management**: Ensuring UI updates matched internal state required careful handling of task movements and deletions

**How I'd approach similar problems in future**:
- Start with clear component contracts and communication patterns before implementation
- Use event-driven architecture for component communication to maintain loose coupling
- Implement comprehensive error handling from the beginning rather than as an afterthought
- Consider performance implications of DOM manipulation strategies early in design phase
