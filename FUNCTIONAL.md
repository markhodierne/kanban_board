# Functional Specification: Kanban Board Application

## Project Overview

A collaborative Kanban board web application for managing tasks across three workflow stages. Users can create, update, move, and delete tasks through an intuitive web interface with persistent data storage and AI-powered task guidance.

## Core Features

### 1. Task Management
- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks via inline forms with title and description
- **View Tasks**: Display tasks organized in three columns (To Do, Doing, Done)
- **Update Tasks**: Inline editing of task titles and descriptions
- **Move Tasks**: Change task status between workflow stages using buttons
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the board permanently
- **AI Advice Generation**: On-demand AI-powered guidance for individual tasks

### 2. AI-Powered Task Guidance
- **On-Demand Generation**: "Get AI Advice" button on each task card
- **Comprehensive Guidance**: AI analyzes task content and provides:
  - Risk management and potential blocker identification
  - Best practices and optimization recommendations
  - Implementation suggestions and efficient approaches
- **Persistent Comments**: Generated advice stored with task in database
- **Re-generation**: Ability to request fresh advice as tasks evolve

### 3. Board Interface
- **Three-Column Layout**: Fixed columns for "To Do", "Doing", and "Done"
- **Enhanced Task Cards**: Visual representation with AI advice display area
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, functional interface that works on desktop browsers
- **Real-time Updates**: Interface reflects current database state

### 4. Data Persistence
- **Database Storage**: All tasks and AI comments stored in PostgreSQL database
- **Status Tracking**: Task workflow position maintained across sessions
- **AI Comment Storage**: Generated advice persisted with tasks
- **Data Integrity**: Consistent task state between browser refreshes

## User Stories

### Primary User Flows
1. **Adding a Task**
   - User clicks "Add Task" or similar interface element
   - User enters task title and optional description via inline form
   - Task appears in "To Do" column immediately
   - Task persists in database

2. **Getting AI Advice**
   - User clicks "Get AI Advice" button on any task card
   - System sends task title and description to external AI API
   - AI analyzes task and generates comprehensive guidance covering:
     - Potential risks and mitigation strategies
     - Best practices and optimization tips
     - Implementation suggestions and efficient approaches
   - Generated advice displays in expandable section on task card
   - Advice comment saves to database for future reference

3. **Moving a Task**
   - User clicks status change button on task card
   - Task moves to appropriate column (To Do → Doing → Done)
   - Status change reflects in database immediately
   - AI advice remains available throughout workflow

4. **Editing a Task**
   - User clicks on task title or description
   - Content becomes editable inline
   - Changes save automatically or on blur/enter
   - Updates persist to database
   - Option to regenerate AI advice for updated task content

5. **Deleting a Task**
   - User clicks delete button on task card
   - Task removes from interface immediately
   - Task and associated AI advice deleted from database permanently

## Technical Requirements

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- JavaScript ES6+ support required
- No mobile optimization needed for workshop scope

### External API Integration
- OpenAI API or similar service for AI advice generation
- API key management for external service authentication
- Error handling for API failures or rate limits
- Graceful fallback when AI service unavailable

### Performance Expectations
- Fast page load times for local development
- Immediate UI feedback for user actions
- Minimal latency for database operations
- Reasonable response times for AI advice generation (2-5 seconds)

### Data Requirements
- Task fields: ID, title, description, status, created timestamp, ai_advice
- AI advice field: Generated text content with timestamp
- Status values: "todo", "doing", "done"
- No user authentication or multi-user support needed

## User Interface Requirements

### Layout
- Fixed three-column grid layout
- Clear column headers with task counts
- Consistent spacing and visual hierarchy

### Enhanced Task Cards
- Task title prominently displayed
- Task description (if provided)
- "Get AI Advice" button prominently placed
- Expandable AI advice section
- Status change buttons
- Delete functionality
- Created date/time display
- AI advice timestamp when available

### AI Advice Display
- Collapsible/expandable advice section
- Clear visual distinction from task content
- Loading indicator during AI generation
- Error messaging for failed AI requests
- "Regenerate Advice" option for updated tasks

### Forms
- Inline task creation forms
- Inline editing capabilities
- Clear save/cancel actions
- Basic form validation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Scope Limitations
- No user authentication system
- No deployment considerations
- No real-time collaboration features
- No task assignment or user management
- No due dates or priority levels
- No drag-and-drop functionality
- AI advice in English only

### Development Constraints
- Workshop timeline: 3-4 hours total development
- Local development environment only
- Minimal external dependencies (except AI API)
- Focus on core functionality over advanced features
- API costs should be minimal for workshop demo

### Security Considerations
- Secure API key storage and handling
- No sensitive data sent to external AI service
- Basic input validation for AI requests
