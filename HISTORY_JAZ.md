# JAZ Development History - Kanban Board Application

## Completed Tickets

### ✅ Ticket 3: Basic HTML Structure & CSS Grid
**Status**: Complete  
**Dependencies**: Ticket 1 (verified complete)

**Key Implementation:**
- Created complete client directory structure: `/client`, `/client/styles`, `/client/scripts`
- Built semantic HTML with three-column Kanban layout
- Implemented CSS Grid (80% screen width, equal columns, 20px gaps)
- Added placeholder content across all workflow stages (To Do, Doing, Done)

**Technical Decisions:**
- **Color Scheme**: Simplified from warm browns to modern 6-color palette:
  - `--color-primary`: #3498db (Blue - To Do)
  - `--color-secondary`: #2c3e50 (Text)  
  - `--color-success`: #27ae60 (Done)
  - `--color-warning`: #f39c12 (Doing)
  - `--color-light`: #ecf0f1 (Backgrounds)
  - `--color-white`: #ffffff (Cards)

- **CSS Architecture**: Implemented shared base classes to reduce code repetition:
  - `.btn` base class for all buttons (reduced 28→13 lines)
  - Consolidated column header borders using `border-color`
  - All CSS colors extracted to root variables for easy theming

**Deviations from Specs:**
- Desktop-only approach (responsive design skipped per user request)
- Color scheme changed twice: warm colors → simplified 6-color modern palette
- Added CSS refactoring for maintainability (not in original ticket)

### ✅ Ticket 6: ApiClient Class  
**Status**: Complete  
**Dependencies**: Ticket 5 (verified complete)

**Key Implementation:**
- Created `client/scripts/ApiClient.js` with static class pattern
- Implemented all 5 CRUD methods mapping to backend endpoints:
  - `getTasks()` → GET `/api/tasks`
  - `createTask()` → POST `/api/tasks` 
  - `updateTask()` → PUT `/api/tasks/:id`
  - `deleteTask()` → DELETE `/api/tasks/:id`
  - `updateTaskStatus()` → PATCH `/api/tasks/:id/status`
- Applied consistent async/await with try/catch error handling
- Returns clean data objects while preserving error context

**Technical Decisions:**
- **Data Return Strategy**: Return `responseData.data` directly instead of full response objects for simpler component interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch blocks with console.error() logging and error re-throwing for component handling
- **Static Class Pattern**: No instantiation needed, accessible from any component
- **ES6 Modules**: Named exports following CLAUDE.md standards

**Standards Compliance:**
- ✅ camelCase method names with descriptive verbs
- ✅ UPPER_SNAKE_CASE constants (`API_BASE_URL`)  
- ✅ Async/await throughout (no Promises)
- ✅ Consistent error handling pattern across all methods

### ✅ Ticket 7: TaskCard Component Class
**Status**: Complete  
**Dependencies**: Ticket 6 (verified complete)

**Key Implementation:**
- Created `client/scripts/TaskCard.js` with ES6 class and full component functionality
- Implemented complete task card rendering with all UI elements
- Added inline editing via double-click for title/description with proper validation
- Status change buttons with dynamic labels (Start → Complete → Restart cycle)
- Delete functionality with confirmation dialog
- Custom event system for Board class communication
- Added CSS styles for inline editing and AI advice placeholder

**Technical Decisions:**
- **Event Delegation**: Component-scoped event handling with custom event bubbling
- **Inline Editing UX**: contentEditable with Enter/Escape/blur handling and text selection
- **State Management**: `isEditing` flag and `originalContent` backup for cancel functionality
- **API Integration**: Optimistic UI updates with error rollback using established ApiClient patterns
- **CSS Extension**: Built on existing design tokens without breaking established patterns

**Standards Compliance:**
- ✅ ES6 class with PascalCase naming (`TaskCard`)
- ✅ camelCase methods with descriptive verbs (`handleStatusChange`, `enableInlineEditing`)
- ✅ kebab-case CSS classes (`task-card`, `ai-advice-section`)
- ✅ Async/await with proper error handling throughout
- ✅ Named exports and static class integration patterns

**AI Preparation:**
- Placeholder AI advice section with dashed border styling ready for Ticket 12

## Current State
- **Component Layer**: TaskCard complete with full CRUD functionality and event system
- **Next Dependencies**: Ready for Ticket 8 (Board Management Class)
- **Integration Ready**: TaskCard events designed for Board class coordination
- **AI Foundation**: UI structure prepared for future AI advice integration

## Key Patterns Established
- **CSS**: Design system extension with editing states and placeholder patterns
- **JavaScript**: Component event delegation, custom event communication, DOM Range API usage
- **API Integration**: Optimistic updates with rollback, consistent error messaging
- **UX Patterns**: Inline editing with keyboard navigation, confirmation dialogs
- **Standards**: All CLAUDE.md conventions consistently applied across tickets
