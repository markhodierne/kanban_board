# JAZ Development History - Kanban Board Application

## Completed Tickets

### ✅ Ticket 3: Basic HTML Structure & CSS Grid
**Status**: Complete  
**Dependencies**: Ticket 1 (verified complete)

**Key Implementation:**
- Created complete client directory structure: `/client`, `/client/styles`, `/client/scripts`
- Built semantic HTML with three-column Kanban layout
- Implemented CSS Grid (80% screen width, equal columns, 20px gaps)
- Added placeholder content across all workflow stages (To Do, Doing, Done)

**Technical Decisions:**
- **Color Scheme**: Simplified from warm browns to modern 6-color palette:
  - `--color-primary`: #3498db (Blue - To Do)
  - `--color-secondary`: #2c3e50 (Text)  
  - `--color-success`: #27ae60 (Done)
  - `--color-warning`: #f39c12 (Doing)
  - `--color-light`: #ecf0f1 (Backgrounds)
  - `--color-white`: #ffffff (Cards)

- **CSS Architecture**: Implemented shared base classes to reduce code repetition:
  - `.btn` base class for all buttons (reduced 28→13 lines)
  - Consolidated column header borders using `border-color`
  - All CSS colors extracted to root variables for easy theming

**Deviations from Specs:**
- Desktop-only approach (responsive design skipped per user request)
- Color scheme changed twice: warm colors → simplified 6-color modern palette
- Added CSS refactoring for maintainability (not in original ticket)

## Current State
- **Foundation Ready**: HTML/CSS foundation complete for frontend development
- **Next Dependencies**: Ticket 4 (Express Server) and Ticket 5 (CRUD API) needed before frontend JS work
- **Standards Established**: CSS custom properties, shared base classes, kebab-case naming
- **Code Quality**: DRY principles applied, no duplication in final CSS

## Key Patterns Established
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Shared base classes (`.btn`, consolidated headers)
- Semantic HTML structure with descriptive class names
- Three-column equal-width grid layout (80% viewport width)
